### **Features**

- Choose From the Menu

  - Random Selection: If you have no idea what to order, will randomly select something new to try off the menu. This can be filtered by drinks, appetizers, or entrees.
  - Learn from current likes/dislikes: Leave a review about if you liked or didn't like the recommendations to make future suggestions better. As it learns more about what you enjoy, suggestions become more personalized to you, and not just what other users like.
  - Recommend to a friend: provide your recommendation to a friend and see what they think of it!

- Where Did My Money Go?

  - Breakdown by category: Group expenses by category to easily filter through necessary expenses (rent, utilities, groceries) and determine which areas are disproportional.
  - Spending alerts: Tell the user when they have started to spend more than their allocated budget (in total or in a certain category). Users can have the choice of locking their account temporarily if this alert appears.
  - Financial planning: after each month, the user receives recommendations for saving money by highlighting specific purchases that could be eliminated or reduced.

- Running Path
  - Filters: find a running path based on distance, elevation, scenic view, etc. Allows for a custom route that prioritizes the needs of the runner.
  - Find running partner: connect with other runners by running together! Match up runners based on location and running patterns to help both reach their goals.
  - Scavenger hunt: lead a runner through a city by creating a route based on specific landmarks and historic sites! For more adventurous and "surprise me" situations.
