# Application Pitch

Name: What Should I Order?

Motivation: Choosing what to order at a restaurant should feel exciting, not stressful. But for many people, it’s a source of anxiety. Do you stick with a safe option, try the most popular dish, or gamble on something completely new? The pressure only grows when dining with friends, on a date, or when trying a new cuisine for the first time. Take away the guesswork so you can focus on enjoying your meal and making your dining experience more fun and stress-free!

Key Features:

- **Personalized Recommendations**: When you search a restaurant, the app suggests a dish curated for you. Over time, as you mark what you liked or disliked, recommendations grow smarter and more tailored to your unique tastes. This reduces stress by helping you explore new foods, while making sure that every order feels like a safe but exciting choice. Now, customers are more likely to try new dishes, turning every meal into a positive experience.

- **Health tracker**: Whether you’re aiming for weight goals, following a fitness plan, or simply trying to eat healthier, the app integrates your preferences with nutritional awareness. Recommendations take your health goals into account while still prioritizing taste, so you can feel confident that your choices align with both your lifestyle and appetite. Users can be confident that trying something new won’t derail their goals, and are encouraged to explore options they might otherwise overlook. Restaurant critics can use this feature to highlight dishes that balance flavor with nutrition.
