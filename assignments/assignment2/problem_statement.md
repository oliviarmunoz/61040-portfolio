# Problem Statement

## Domain

Trying New Restaurants: I love trying new restaurants, especially ones from different cultures. It’s a great way to hang out with friends and explore whatever city I’m in. I feel like I end up trying a new restaurant but never really branching out in terms of food itself. I suspect that I’m not getting the full experience at a restaurant, and I don't want to miss out on anything.

## Problem

Menu indecision: Whenever I look at the menu at a new restaurant, I often struggle with deciding what to order at a restaurant. I spend too much time thinking about what to get, and by the time the waiter comes to take my order, I either end up ordering the same thing or picking something at random with mixed results. I have the feeling that I’m missing out on trying new foods that I would enjoy.

## Stakeholder List

- Restaurant Owners: People responsible for designing the menu and promoting certain dishes
- Customers: Diners who use the app to decide what to order
- Restaurant Critics: Individuals who review and recommend dishes to the public

Impacts: Owners and critics may have biases toward promoting specific dishes, which could lead to a difference in items recommended by the restaurant and the app. Customers stand to benefit most by discovering meals they enjoy, but there is a risk of dissatisfaction if recommendations don’t match their tastes.

_Comparables:_

- [Google Maps Reviews](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6230175?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid): Users can share their experience with a specific restaurant and rate it on a scale from 1 to 5, leaving comments and/or recommendations. There doesn't seem to be any other interactions among users, other than to provide feedback on their experience. This is more announcement-style rather than social-media-style and not personalized to the user.

- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/): Similar to above, Yelp allows users to rate their experience at a particular business or service. These reviews can be filtered by specific criteria, and users need an account to rate something on Yelp.

- Word of Mouth: A common informal solution is to ask the waiter for a recommendation. There is a lot of variability with this, as some people just promote the most commonly ordered menu item.
