### **Domains**

_Brain dump (idea generation):_

- _Micro-Decisions_: I have a million tiny decisions to make every day. Some of them are obvious. Some of them are pretty meaningless, but I can't bring myself to make the decision.
- _Office Hours_: As an MIT student, I am in office hours quite often. Most office hours have a structure where you sign up in a queue and then wait to get help individually.
- _Money_: As I start to make more spending money, I want to be more deliberate with my spending. I worry if I am spending money carelessly.
- _Friend Check-in_: I like to keep up with friends I haven't spoken to in a long time. I think it helps me maintain connections. Sometimes I forget to check in with people, which could make them feel unimportant.
- _Job Tracker_: We live in a time of mass applying to jobs, research positions, extracurriculars, etc. I get a million confirmation emails but I like to keep things organized
- _Restaurants_: I'm becoming more of a foodie, so I have taken a liking to trying new foods, especially those from different cultures.
- _Getting Around Campus_: I live on campus, so I naturally spend almost every day wandering around campus. MIT has a pretty large main campus with lots of connected buildings, which can be confusing to get around.
- _Lecture Boredom_: As a senior, I've taken many, many classes. I've also taught classes a few times. It's really hard to understand when students are engaged and when you could skip things.
- _Running Paths_: Like many people in their early 20s, I have taken up running. I am getting bored of the same thing every time, so I want to spice things up.
- _Spontaneity Generator_: I love hanging out with my friends. When we have free time, we have many things we like to do but it always has to be a super planned out thing. I wish we could do more casual things that don't require as much planning.

_More fleshed out ideas (with explanations)_

#### 1. **Restaurants**

I love trying new restaurants, especially ones from different cultures. It’s a great way to hang out with friends and explore Boston. I’m always looking for places that are unique or hole-in-the-wall, but I tend to default to the same spots out of convenience. There’s potential for a project that helps people discover and track restaurants/specific foods they want to try, without the clutter of review overload.

#### 2. **Money**

During busy weeks or exam season, I often lose track of how I’m spending money. I’ll look at my credit card bill and be surprised by how much I’ve spent on food or random purchases. I’d like to be more aware of where my money is going, but without having to manually budget or input expenses. This could be valuable to many students who are busy and still learning about personal finance.

#### 3. **Running Paths**

I enjoy long-distance running, especially outdoors. However, I often get bored of running the same routes. Treadmills bore me, and existing running apps often focus on tracking stats rather than helping me discover interesting or scenic routes that fit my mood, schedule, or environment. I’d love a way to discover interesting or new running paths that match my preferences.
