### **Problems**

- Restaurants

  - Restaurant Recommendations: In cities with many dining options, I get overwhelmed by the sheer number of restaurants. This often results in sticking to familiar spots and missing out on hidden gems or unique cuisines.
  - Unpredictable Wait Times: Popular restaurants sometimes have long, unclear wait times. While big places offer waitlists or reservations, smaller or local spots rarely do, which leads to wasted time and frustration when arriving to long lines unexpectedly.
  - Menu Indecision: I struggle a lot with deciding what to order at a restaurant. I want to try new dishes but end up ordering the same thing or picking something at random with mixed results. This indecision makes my dining experience worse and limits my willingness to explore.

- Money

  - Where Did My Money Go?: After weeks of spending casually, I find it difficult to track where my money is going. I want an easy way to see how much I spend on necessities versus discretionary items, so I can budget better without manually entering every expense.
  - Lack of Savings Guidance: It’s hard to know how much I should realistically save after receiving a paycheck. Without clear benchmarks or advice tailored to my age and situation, financial planning feels impossible and overwhelming.
  - Invest: I’m unsure where and how to invest money wisely. The complexity of diversifying portfolios and risk management makes investing intimidating, especially since strategies used by wealthy investors may not suit an average person.

- Running
  - Finding a New Route: Discovering good running paths, especially when in new areas, is challenging. Running the same route repeatedly gets boring, and it’s hard to know which paths are safe, scenic, or meet my preferred distance and terrain.
  - Keeping Pace: It’s easy to unintentionally speed up or slow down while running. I want a way to maintain an ideal pace without constantly checking my watch or relying on others.
  - Playlists: I enjoy listening to the same songs when I run, but after some time, I like to switch things up. Sometimes I'm in the mood to listen to something new, or just something different. I hate having to run without music, so it would also be nice to tailor it to my running speed.
