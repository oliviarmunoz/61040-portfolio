# Exercise 4

### Defining familiar Concepts

**URL Shortener**: Define a concept for the essential function of a URL shortening service such as tinyurl.com or bit.ly. Your concept should support both user-defined and autogenerated URL suffixes.

```
concept URLShortener
  purpose
    map long URLs to shorter, more convenient aliases

  principle
    after a user submits their original URL,
    they will receive a new URL (either user-defined or autogenerated) that when accessed,
    will redirect the user to the original (longer) URL

  state
    a set of shortURLs with
        a nickname String,
        a redirectedURL String

  actions
    createGenericNickname (redirectedURL: String): (shortURL: shortURL)
        requires: a valid, reachable redirectedURL
        effects: returns a new shortURL with a unique autogenerated nickname shorter than the original URL

    createCustomNickname (redirectedURL: String, nickname: String): (shortURL: shortURL)
        requires: a valid, reachable redirectedURL
        effects: returns a new shortURL using the specified nickname. If the nickname was already associated with a redirectedURL, overwrites it.

    redirect (nickname: String):
        requires: a currently existing nickname
        effects: redirects the user to the redirectedURL corresponding to the nickname

    delete (nickname: String)
        requires: a currently existing nickname
        effects: removes the corresponding shortURL
```

**Billable Hours Tracking**: Many companies that bill clients for work by the hour use tracking software to help automate record keeping. Define a concept that handles the core functionality. Assume that, in the application that uses this concept, an employee marks the beginning of a session by selecting a project and entering a string describing the work to be done, and then marks the end of the session with another interaction. Think about how to handle a case in which someone forgets to end a session.

```
concept BillableHourTracking
  purpose
    record time spent by employees on client-related work

  principle
    after a user selects a project and describe the task,
    their work session begins.
    The session ends when the employee clocks out.
    If the session is not ended manually, the system can infer an end time based on the estimated duration in the description.

  state
    a set of workPeriods with
        a project String,
        a description String,
        a startTime DateTime,
        an optional endTime DateTime
        an anticipatedDuration DateTime,
        an employeeId String

  actions
    clockIn (employeeId: String, project: String, description: String, anticipatedDuration: Duration, currentTime: DateTime): workPeriod
      requires: valid project and non-empty description
      effects: creates a new workPeriod with startTime equal to the currentTime. If an existing active session exists for this employee (their session has no endTime), sets its endTime to its startTime + anticipatedDuration before creating the new session

    clockOut (employeeId: String, currentTime: DateTime)
      requires: only one active workPeriod exists for the employee (session with no endTime)
      effects: sets endTime of the current workPeriod to currentTime
```

### Additional notes

I made the choice to take the employees' anticipatedDuration time at face value and make the endTime equal to startTime + this value if they forget to end a session. I believe this is the easiest and best way to approximate the actual hours worked, rather than randomly guessing or basing it off their prior schedule.

**Conference Room Booking**: Define a concept for the essential function of a service for booking conference rooms in a company or university department, like CSAILâ€™s room booking system. Note: you do not need to include recurring bookings.

```
concept BookConferenceRoom
  purpose
    Reserve and manage single-use conference room bookings across specified times and rooms.

  principle
    after a user selects a room, date/time, and duration,
    available slots for that room are displayed,
    after which the user can select a slot to reserve

  state
    a set of Bookings with
        an owner String,
        a slot Slot
    a set of Slots with
        a room String,
        a dateAndTime DateTime,
        a duration Integer,
        a claimed boolean

  actions
    createBooking (owner: String, slot: Slot): (booking: Booking)
        requires: slot exists and is unclaimed
        effects: returns a new Booking for the owner with that slot

    deleteBooking (owner: String, slot: Slot): (booking: Booking)
        requires: an existing Booking for that owner for that slot.
        effects: removes the Booking for that owner with that slot. Marks the slot as unclaimed

    seeAvailableSlots (owner: String, currentTime: DateTime, room: String, dateAndTime: DateTime, duration: Integer):
        requires: dateAndTime is in the future (after currentTime); valid room name
        effects: displays all available (unclaimed) slots for the given room, dateAndTime, and duration


```
