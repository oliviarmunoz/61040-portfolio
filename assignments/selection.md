## **Selection**

- Menu Indecision (Restaurants): I chose this problem because itâ€™s a common frustration among my friends and me. There is a lack of intuitive tools to help diners choose meals confidently, beyond random selection. It also encourages continuous engagement as people explore new dishes regularly, which could allow the app to improve with user input.
- Where Did My Money Go? (Money): I chose this problem because many students like me spend without really thinking about their habits. A simple, low-effort way to visualize spending could promote better budgeting and financial responsibility. This problem is ongoing and relevant for a large user base, which is good for repeated use.
- Finding a Path (Running): I chose this problem because it's filling a specific niche but it's still super useful + scalable. I think people would benefit from this because it helps keep people safe and adds some variety to their run.

## **Exclusions**

- Restaurant Recommendations: I did not choose this problem because I feel like it is a good idea, but it's so similar to Beli/Google Maps. There isn't much else for it to expand to. I also think that this could fall into the same pitfall as some of these apps that only recommend super expensive restaurants.
- Queue Trackers: I did not choose this problem because I think that most restaurants have reservations or some other way to get a guaranteed spot. You can also call the restaurant if you really want to, so I think other solutions are better.
- Save Money: I did not choose this problem because I think once you already know the answer to this, you won't need to use it again. It just seems like it would have a short lifespan for each user.
- Invest: I did not choose this problem because I think there is a lot of risk with recommending things to invest in (market manipulation?), especially if things don't end up being succesfull for the average person.
- Keeping Pace: I did not choose this problem because I think there are many ways to go about addressing this issue. For example, you can probably just listen to songs with a certain BPM or use tracking apps on your watch. I don't know if there would be a lot of use for it beyond just this one specific goal, so it might be hard to expand.
- Playlist: I did not choose this problem because there are already existing products that address this issue (think Spotify AI generated playlists). I think it is a good idea, but it isn't very reusable. Once someone has made a playlist, they don't necessarily need to make another one.
